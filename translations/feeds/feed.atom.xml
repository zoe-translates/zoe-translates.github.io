Have accompanied us along the way.
Outside these city walls we must now part
And be scattered in wind like scraps of hay.
This sunset sees friendship become longing,
For neither clouds nor wayfarers can stay.
We strain to bid farewell for one last time,
But our horses won’t hush their plaintive neigh.

The beautiful maid does retire.
She shines in her crown of laurel leaves
While clasping the murmuring lyre.
She pours out her tears in a poem,
Her instrument singing along.
But sadness still swells in her bosom,
And breaches her hold of the song.
She sang of her dignified glory,
Of lights in the cosmic wonder,
Of treacherous people, of loving,
Betrayal, and Age’s plunder,]]></summary>

With playful sparks, burning and brightening,
That a gently raised glimpse may tend,
And, like a cloud-strewn ring of lightning,
Your graceful glance would let descend…
Still there’s a charm of greater powers:
You gaze on the ash of a zeal
That once shone through passion-kissed hours;
Your eyelashes hardly conceal
The dim embers where desire cowers.

In a small city,
Where the twilight is eternal
And bells let out eternal chimes.
And in a small, cosy lodge in the countryside —
Delicate ringing
Of ancient hours — like little droplets of time.
And sometimes, in the evening, out of an attic somewhere —
Flute sounds,
The flautist at the window.
And large tulips are on the windowsills.
And you, by any chance, might have even loved me…]]></summary>
