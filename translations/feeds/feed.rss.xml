        <description type="html"><![CDATA[The rolling green hills and a pale river
Have accompanied us along the way.
Outside these city walls we must now part
And be scattered in wind like scraps of hay.
This sunset sees friendship become longing,
For neither clouds nor wayfarers can stay.
We strain to bid farewell for one last time,
But our horses won’t hush their plaintive neigh.

How many it has drowned!
That day of my departure will be dawning:
The void is where I’m bound.
All shall be stilled: the singing, the vying,
The shining and the striving,
My eyes’ green sparks, my voice, mild and caring,
And my hair of gold, flowing.
Then life will carry on, as plain as ever,
And memories will fade
The way as if beneath the skies I never]]></description>

The beautiful maid does retire.
She shines in her crown of laurel leaves
While clasping the murmuring lyre.
She pours out her tears in a poem,
Her instrument singing along.
But sadness still swells in her bosom,
And breaches her hold of the song.
She sang of her dignified glory,
Of lights in the cosmic wonder,
Of treacherous people, of loving,
Betrayal, and Age’s plunder,]]></description>

So weak, like a heartless body that lingers in vain,
An empty shade, beleaguered by pity and pain,
My one and only desire is death: there’s nothing more.
Do not fall into enmity and let hatred pour
Toward the one whose heart is cleansed of power’s stain,
Growing this exile’s ache past where itself could attain:]]></description>

        <description type="html"><![CDATA[I love your eyes, my dearest friend,
With playful sparks, burning and brightening,
That a gently raised glimpse may tend,
And, like a cloud-strewn ring of lightning,
Your graceful glance would let descend…
Still there’s a charm of greater powers:
You gaze on the ash of a zeal
That once shone through passion-kissed hours;
Your eyelashes hardly conceal
The dim embers where desire cowers.

        <description type="html"><![CDATA[…I’d like, maybe, to live with you
In a small city,
Where the twilight is eternal
And bells let out eternal chimes.
And in a small, cosy lodge in the countryside —
Delicate ringing
Of ancient hours — like little droplets of time.
And sometimes, in the evening, out of an attic somewhere —
Flute sounds,
The flautist at the window.
And large tulips are on the windowsills.
And you, by any chance, might have even loved me…]]></description>

With longing — calm, pristine
Cradled in your arm a city sleeps
Where my dreams are slow and serene
A feeble lamp, under a half-moon window
I see your name — laces of gold and silver
For five decades binding me in their coils
A sea of longing —
In the tranquil, walled city
Sweetest voices descend and their petals scatter
Over the dream-fabrics on my skin]]></description>

In the haze of slumber,
I strain to find ways — as I must —
Toward you, to shelter.
I see a steamboat with its mast,
And you are there, aboard…
You, in the train’s fumes… Fields are vast,
Where twilight’s grief is poured…
Fields at twilight heavy with dew,
Above, ravens take wing…
To the Earth’s four corners, for you,
My benedictions ring!]]></description>

O you, furious issue of the glowing night!

One hundred thousand times — pledging to you: Anna
Akhmatova! — escapes as a sigh of protest
That sinks into the namelessness of Gehenna.

That winds its way to your murmuring shore.

A day like no other.
‘Tis to you, I am confiding,
In case I should wander —
Whoever’s lips I’d be kissing
As time strikes for lovers,
Whomever I’d pledge to, trembling
With the midnight’s darkness, —
Live, as passed from mother to child,
Like blossoms blossoming,
Never letting glances go wild
To someone, fancying…
See that cypress cross, so little?
— It is your memento —]]></description>
