      "summary": "If translation means re-creating the inner experiences of reading, we encounter a fundamental indeterminacy when translating classical texts. The time­span that makes a classical text classic also obliterates what is fleeting in time. However, among the ephemeral existences, it is the subtle mental realities that we aim to re-create by translation. We are thus placed in the ambiguous territory tantalizingly out of the reach of our empathy.\nThe disappearance of these vulnerable mental experiences can happen on all levels of reading.",
